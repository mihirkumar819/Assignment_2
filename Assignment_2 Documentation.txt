 Problem Statement : create a random quote application
  		  every 20 second a random quote will be displayed on the screen
		  you can create an array of 10 quotes.
 While doing assignment i learnt many different functions of JavaScript and also learnt about generating random 
number using math.random() and about array in javascript.

I took references from https://parade.com/937586/parade/life-quotes/  for Quotes.
